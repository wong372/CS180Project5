Project 5 Outline: 

Abstract: Project 4, with GUI, concurrency and network IO added. 

Details: 
- All interactions must take place over GUI (complex and JOPtionpane). 
- All file operations (data writing and reading) must take place on the server. 
- Multiple users (instances of client) must be able to connect at once. 
- New content or changes made by one user must be visible after refresh by other users. 

Problems: 
- Might be too complicated down the road to simply separate the classes; might require a rewrite to fully implement new features. 
- 

TODO:
- create a log out button (make sure program doesn't end // i think that would kick all concurrent users out of the program as well)
- create a refresh button
- implement concurrency

DONE? (move from TODO instead of deleting)
-
